Before creating this extension, we have talked about making IOS and Android application for Github Trending page. After that, we found out that they have been created already by some other guys. So, we looked for platform which does not have Github Trending. It turned out to be Chrome Extension. I hope it would be useful for all Github and Chrome users.
